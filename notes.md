Suggestions for Improvement
1. Code Quality & Structure
Add Type Hints & Documentation:

Add comprehensive docstrings for all methods
Improve type hints (currently minimal)
Add error handling documentation
Refactor for Better Organization:

Split the large ClaudeCLI class into smaller, focused classes
Create separate modules for different functionalities
Add a config.py for configuration management
2. Error Handling & Robustness
Improve Error Handling:

Add specific exception classes for different error types
Implement retry logic for network failures
Add validation for API responses
Better handling of malformed JSON files
Add Input Validation:

Validate file paths before operations
Sanitize user inputs
Check API key format before making requests
3. Features & Functionality
Enhanced Configuration:

Add configuration file support (.clauderc or config.yaml)
Support for multiple API key profiles
Configurable model presets
Default system prompts
Improved Interactive Mode:

Add command history support
Implement tab completion
Add multi-line input support
Better formatting for long responses
File Management:

Add conversation export to different formats (markdown, txt, html)
Implement conversation search functionality
Add conversation metadata (timestamps, tokens used)
4. Performance & Scalability
Optimize API Usage:

Implement conversation truncation for long sessions
Add streaming support for real-time responses
Implement local caching for repeated queries
Add progress indicators for long operations
5. Testing & Development
Add Testing Framework:

Unit tests for core functionality
Integration tests for API interactions
Mock tests for offline development
Add pytest to requirements
Development Tools:

Add code formatting (black, isort)
Add linting (flake8, pylint)
Add pre-commit hooks
Add GitHub Actions for CI/CD
6. User Experience
Better CLI Interface:

Add shell completion scripts
Implement subcommands structure
Add verbose/quiet modes
Better help text and examples
Documentation:

Add inline help for interactive commands
Create man page
Add usage examples
Document API rate limits
7. Security & Privacy
Security Improvements:

Secure API key storage (keyring integration)
Add conversation encryption option
Implement secure file permissions
Add option to exclude sensitive data from logs
8. Packaging & Distribution
Professional Packaging:

Create setup.py or pyproject.toml
Add entry points for global installation
Create wheel distribution
Add version management
Installation Options:

Add pip installable package
Create conda package
Add Docker containerization
Create portable executable
9. Monitoring & Logging
Add Logging:

Implement structured logging
Add debug mode
Track API usage statistics
Add performance metrics
